Simulation-of-automatic-door-opening
====================================

This project is dedicated to be used in securised door opening. Our objectif is to realize a hole solution to let only authorized people to pass on a door. It can be used on labos or secured facilities
It's devided on two parts:

The first one is a facial recognition programm that allow to know if this person is authorized to pass or not (If he exist with a "True" value of the pass atribut on the database). We used OpenCV and JavaCV as Wrapper


The second part is an embedded system that will control th door's opening. It takes the opening or not decision from the the a value provided by the first part. We will use a STM32 embedded card

We are actually working on the both part, This is the release of our advancement on the first part
